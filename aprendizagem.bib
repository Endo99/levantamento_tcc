abstract = {Software Processes belong to those knowledge areas of software engineering that are less suitable to be taught classically in lectures. Class projects which frequently complement lectures are limited by academic settings in various ways too. Simulation and digital game-based learning are considered to have great potential to extend the learning experiences beyond lectures and class projects, help to develop insight into the necessity of software processes and to widen the perspective of software engineering students in a virtual and efficient way. Several efforts made by different research groups show encouraging results. This research gathers preliminary findings, develops new ideas and gives suggestions to exhaust the potential further and to encourage the wider application of digital game-based learning in software engineering education. These suggestions are the foundation for building blocks of a new framework for simulation based digital learning games aiming to teach software engineering processes more effectively and efficiently.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of different musical styles on learning in virtual-immersive environments. As shown in other studies, music and musical training has positive effects on spatial-temporal reasoning (e.g., maths, chess). Music is also used in therapies to reduce stress or to aid children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In our study we want to use the findings from former investigations and combine these to create a holistic, immersive learning experience. The idea involves creating a 3d model of the Macquarie University icon (the Macquarie Lighthouse in Sydney) and use this model to develop a course about the history of the lighthouse. The users can explore the virtual environment in the style of a 3d adventure game and they will learn about the history of the lighthouse and colonial Sydney by interacting with virtual avatars. Within this framework we want to investigate the effect of Classical music, Rock/Pop music, Didgeridoo music, RAP music and compare these with nature sounds, white noise and silent conditions. We want to find out which musical style is most beneficial for learning and motivation in virtual-immersive environments. Our hypothesis is that instrumental music with a rate of 50 - 70 beats per minute (BPM) will be most beneficial for learning. This hypothesis is supported by other studies but has not been tested in virtual and immersive environments.},

abstract = {Recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) using self-game-play has shown remarkable performance on several board games as well as video games (e.g., Atari games and Dota2). DeepMind researchers have already implemented model-free RL to play Go and Chess at a superhuman level using neural Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search (neural MCTS). Therefore, it is plausible to consider that RL, starting from zero knowledge, can be applied to other problems which can be converted into games. We try to leverage the computational power of neural MCTS to solve a class of combinatorial optimization problems. Following the idea of Hintikka's Game-Theoretical Semantics, we propose the Zermelo Gamification (ZG) to transform specific combinatorial optimization problems into Zermelo games whose winning strategies correspond to the solutions of the original optimization problem. The ZG also provides a specially designed neural MCTS. We use a combinatorial planning problem for which the ground-truth policy is efficiently computable to demonstrate that ZG is promising.},

abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG)-based game design aims to reach a new way of playing games by focusing gameplay around algorithmic game content generation. However, positioning interaction with PCG systems and generated content to the center of player experience poses design challenges for both game design and AI design. In order to create the wanted affordances, rich contextual information is required to make informed decisions on the generated content. While previous research has presented excellent developments on PCG’s possibilities, further considering context and affordances in the early stages of prototyping may aid designers reach these possibilities in a more consistent manner. This study is set to discuss how context, affordances and the game’s overall design can be considered during the prototyping process of PCG-based games. Misaligned game context and affordances can result in deeply rooted design issues that may later manifest as subpar gameplay experiences and increased development effort. These emergent issues are examined through a post-mortem case study to produce an extended PCG-based design process, featuring actionable steps, that takes context, affordances, and the game’s overall design into account through meaningful play.},

Scratch, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed software was used to facilitate game design. The pre-test was used to establish a baseline measure for comparison with the post-test measure, with the comparison indicating effectiveness of the dependent variable. Video recordings and artifacts were gathered to obtain richer data of the experience. Researchers agree that there is a lack of empirically-grounded frameworks for integrating gaming activities into classrooms.

abstract = {Games for learning cannot take the same design approach as games when targeting audiences. While players of entertainment games have the luxury of choosing games that suit them, students using digital games for learning typically have a single game for them to learn from, regardless of whether or not it fits their playing style or learning needs. We contend that this problem can be addressed by creating games that identify the kind of player-learner using the game and adapts itself to best fit that individual. These adaptive games can specialize themselves according to a student's learning needs, gameplay preferences, and learning style. We present a prototype mini-game, called S.C.R.U.B., which employs this method for teaching microbiology concepts.},

While reflection occurs in educational games, the educational game design and research community can benefit from more knowledge of how to facilitate player reflection through game design. In this paper, we examine educational programming games and analyze how reflection is currently supported. We find that current approaches prioritize accuracy over the individual learning process and often only support reflection post-gameplay. Our analysis identifies common reflective features, and we develop a set of open areas for future work. We discuss these promising directions towards engaging the community in developing more mechanics for reflection in educational games. },

abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can be used to design game-based learning systems because it has the excellent ability of concept representation and reasoning. However, it can not (1) get new knowledge from existing data and (2) correct false transcendental knowledge by itself, which mars the game-based learning ability. This paper utilizes Hebbian learning rule to solve the first problem and uses unbalance degree to solve the second problem. As a result, the improved FCM has the ability of self-learning from both existing data and priori knowledge, and is more suitable for a game-based learning system. Based on the improved FCM, a novel game-based learning model is proposed, including a teacher submodel, a learner submodel and a set of learning mechanisms. The teacher submodel has the standard answers which can be deduced from the improved FCM. The learner submodel is bulit and adjusted according to the teacher's FCM, which reflects the learner's learning process. The learning mechanisms compute the difference between the outputs of the teacher submodel and the learner submodel, and control the whole game learning process according to the difference. Based on the proposed model, an automobile driving learning system is developed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our model validity in terms of controlling the learning process and the guiding learners learning.},

abstract = {The conventional way of teaching IT is increasingly not attractive to students of today. For example, covering the various topics in Computer Science is not exactly exciting when students are taught the theory and then asked to practice by coming up with solutions to "made-up" problems. These solutions then get discarded when they move on to a new topic. A computer game can involve most and possibly all topics in Computer Science. When working on computer games, instead of discarding solutions that students worked on earlier, students learn to incorporate solutions to previous problems into newer solutions. The final product is a lot more sophisticated and students can actually feel proud of what they have achieved. They can also have enjoyed themselves along the way. They would have learnt that topics they have studied had a purpose. This is useful, as quite often, students cannot figure out why they need to study a particular topic, especially if they are finding it hard. In this paper, we suggest that game construction can be an effective learning tool.},

abstract = {A particular challenge of the game design process is when the designer is requested to orchestrate dissimilar elements of games such as visuals, audio, narrative and rules to achieve a specific play experience. Within the domain of adversarial first person shooter games, for instance, a designer must be able to comprehend the differences between the weapons available in the game, and appropriately craft a game level to take advantage of strengths and weaknesses of those weapons. As an initial study towards computationally orchestrating dissimilar content generators in games, this paper presents a computational model which can classify a matchup of a team-based shooter game as balanced or as favoring one or the other team. The computational model uses convolutional neural networks to learn how game balance is affected by the level, represented as an image, and each team's weapon parameters. The model was trained on a corpus of over 50,000 simulated games with artificial agents on a diverse set of levels created by 39 different generators. The results show that the fusion of levels, when processed by a convolutional neural network, and weapon parameters yields an accuracy far above the baseline but also improves accuracy compared to artificial neural networks or models which use partial information, such as only the weapon or only the level as input.},

Motivated by the need to disrupt the multibillion dollar illegal smuggling networks, such as wildlife and drug trafficking, this paper introduces a fundamental shift in learning adversary behavior in NSGs by focusing the accuracy of the model using the downstream game that will be solved. Further, the paper addresses technical challenges in building such a game-focused learning model by i) applying graph convolutional networks to NSGs to achieve tractability and differentiability and ii) using randomized block updates of the coefficients of the defender's optimization in order to scale the approach to large networks. We show that our game-focused approach yields scalability and higher defender expected utility than models trained for accuracy only.},

abstract = {In recent years, online gaming has become one of the most popular Internet activities, but cheating activity, such as the use of game bots, has increased as a consequence. Generally, the gaming community disapproves of the use of game bots, as bot users obtain unreasonable rewards without corresponding efforts. However, bots are hard to detect because they are designed to simulate human game playing behavior and they follow game rules exactly. Existing detection approaches either disrupt players' gaming experiences, or they assume game bots are run as standalone clients or assigned a specific goal, such as aim bots in FPS games.In this paper, we propose a manifold learning approach for detecting game bots. It is a general technique that can be applied to any game in which avatars' movement is controlled by the players directly. Through real-life data traces, we show that the trajectories of human players and those of game bots are very different. In addition, although game bots may endeavor to simulate players' decisions, certain human behavior patterns are difficult to mimic because they are AI-hard. Taking Quake 2 as a case study, we evaluate our scheme's performance based on real-life traces. The results show that the scheme can achieve a detection accuracy of 98% or higher on a trace of 700 seconds.},

abstract = {Jobs in the computing field demand communication and teamwork skills in addition to programming skills. Focus at the undergraduate level needs to be shifted towards developing these collaborative skills to enable a more smooth transition into employment in industry. The University of Victoria is in its second year of offering a course on game design. In the first offering, new activities were introduced to address issues identified by recent studies on university graduates entering industry. We focused on integrating cooperative learning, group orientation, and peer review activities into the game design process. The course attracted students across multiple disciplines, and an analysis indicated increased student interest in pursuing a computer science degree. Unfortunately, the same pre- and post-surveys suggested that our collaborative activities may have resulted in a decrease in student interest regarding course work and in pursuing studies in game design. In this paper we report on how we used a studio-based pedagogical approach to restructure the peer review activities in our course. In our previous offering, students received peer feedback only on their final game presentation. In our latest offering, we integrated peer review activities into every step of the game development process, allowing students to refine their ideas while progressing through a game project. A quantitative analysis informs us that our refined peer review activities were successful in increasing student presentation confidence, sense of community, and excitement towards their course projects.},

abstract = {The hardest part of making a game has always been the engineering. In times past, game engineering was mainly about low-level optimization—writing code that would run quickly on the target computer, leveraging clever little tricks whenever possible. But in the past ten years, games have ballooned in complexity. Now the primary technical challenge is simply getting the code to work to produce an end result that bears some semblance to the desired functionality. To the extent that we optimize, we are usually concerned with high-level algorithmic choices. There’s such a wide variety of algorithms to know about, so much experience required to implement them in a useful way, and so much work overall that just needs to be done, that we have a perpetual shortage of qualified people in the industry.},

With the enhancement of information technology, Web-based learning has been promoted as an alternative teaching and learning methodology. Digital games, an interactive piece of technology within the multimedia learning environment, could foster the learning process effectively and interestingly especially among young learners. Researchers and game designers have noted this promising technology and proposed some frameworks and models to foster multimedia learning environment. However, most of the models do not address the learning behavior in game design, which is important to facilitate learning process in game-based learning. In view of this, this paper focuses on proposing and discussing components that leverage the pedagogical aspects in designing game-based learning environment.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence for the creation of game agents is fundamental to digital game development, enabling the design of new styles of games offering novel play experiences. Machine learning has long been used in the creation of digital games, most often for the purpose of creating game agent controllers that are trained off-line and do not learn during play. Little attention has been given to the possibility of game designs or mechanics that use machine learning to allow the player to train game agents on-line. This document outlines the design and implementation of Oui, Chef!!, a supervised learning game in which the player trains neural networks to map recipes to the ingredients necessary to make dishes in a restaurant. The game demonstrates that training game agents in a supervised manner provides a fun and engaging player experience wherein the effects of training are easily recognizable, and sometimes delightfully surprising.},

Using evolutionary computation to evolve the weights for a neural network could create an effective/adaptive controller that does not require extensive programmer input.

abstract = {A long-standing goal in artificial intelligence and robotics is synthesising agents that can effectively learn and adapt throughout their lifetime. One open-ended approach to behaviour learning in autonomous robots is online evolution, which is part of the evolutionary robotics field of research. In online evolution approaches, an evolutionary algorithm is executed on the robots during task execution, which enables continuous optimisation and adaptation of behaviour. Despite the potential for automatic behaviour learning, online evolution has not been widely adopted because it often requires several hours or days to synthesise solutions to a given task. In this respect, research in the field has failed to develop a prevalent algorithm able to effectively synthesise solutions to a large number of different tasks in a timely manner. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we argue for more general mechanisms that can combine the benefits of different algorithms to increase the performance of online evolution of robot controllers. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of a novel approach called online hyper-evolution (OHE). Robots executing OHE use the different sources of feedback information traditionally associated with controller evaluation to find effective evolutionary algorithms during task execution. First, we study two approaches: OHE-fitness, which uses the fitness score of controllers as the criterion to select promising algorithms over time, and OHE-diversity, which relies on the behavioural diversity of controllers for algorithm selection. We then propose a novel class of techniques called OHE-hybrid, which combine diversity and fitness to search for suitable algorithms. In addition to their effectiveness at selecting suitable algorithms, the different OHE approaches are evaluated for their ability to construct algorithms by controlling which algorithmic components should be employed for controller generation (e.g., mutation, crossover, among others), an unprecedented approach in evolutionary robotics. Results show that OHE (i) facilitates the evolution of controllers with high performance, (ii) can increase effectiveness at different stages of evolution by combining the benefits of multiple algorithms over time, and (iii) can be effectively applied to construct new algorithms during task execution. Overall, our study shows that OHE is a powerful new paradigm that allows robots to improve their learning process as they operate in the task environment.},

abstract = {The routing game models congestion in transportation networks, communication networks, and other cyber-physical systems in which agents compete for shared resources. We consider an online learning model of player dynamics: at each iteration, every player chooses a route (or a probability distribution over routes, which corresponds to a flow allocation over the physical network), then the joint decision of all players determines the costs of each path, which are then revealed to the players.We pose the following estimation problem: given a sequence of player decisions and the corresponding costs, we would like to estimate the parameters of the learning model. We consider, in particular, entropic mirror descent dynamics and reduce the problem to estimating the learning rates of each player.In order to demonstrate our methods, we developed a web application that allows players to participate in a distributed, online routing game, and we deployed the application on Amazon Mechanical Turk. When players log in, they are assigned an origin and destination on a shared network. They can choose, at each iteration, a distribution over their available routes, and each player seeks to minimize her own cost. We collect a dataset using this platform, then apply the proposed method to estimate the learning rates of each player. We observe, in particular, that after an exploration phase, the joint decision of the players remains within a small distance of the set of equilibria. We also use the estimated model parameters to predict the flow distribution over routes, and compare our predictions to the actual distributions, showing that the online learning model can be used as a predictive model over short horizons. Finally, we discuss some of the qualitative insights from the experiments, and give directions for future research.},

In this paper, we investigate human-AI collaboration in the context of a collaborative AI-driven word association game with partially observable information. In our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human. We also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. Our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner's attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an AI partner. We also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss AI agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-AI collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. Our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-AI interaction and communication.},

abstract = {Competition is useful in game-based learning, although it can also generate negative influences. To expand the potential for competition models in game-based learning, this study proposes the notion of surrogate competition, which eliminates direct competition between students. Such surrogates could be employed as buffers so that the competition between students is more relaxed. To explore the possible benefits of a surrogate approach to competition, the My-Pet-My-Arena system has been developed and evaluated. Two empirical studies were conducted to examine the effects of the surrogate competition. The results revealed that surrogate competition enhanced students’ learning achievement as well as increased their motivation. Furthermore, the surrogate competition might also assist students in attributing competitive failures to a lack of effort. Working from the results obtained in these two studies, a general model of surrogate competition is proposed to help designers implement forms of surrogate competition in other systems for game-based learning.},

abstract = {Although many computer games have become diversified in recent years, much effort and ingenuity are needed to produce games that persons with visual impairments can enjoy. However, game developers face difficulties in adjusting the parameters of these games, including difficulty and interface features, because the control skills and disability conditions of gamers vary. Thus, it is essential to establish a scheme to evaluate game interfaces and stages with individuals trials with a short time. In this study, our purpose is to propose and establish the concept of GAME (Game As a Measurement Environment) that can evaluate game interfaces and stages. This concept aims to divide a game stage into substages and then randomly allocate them to the stage. Then, the generated stage records the play logs and play conditions and then analyzes them logs based on test theories, including classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Based on the analysis of the gathered play logs of side-scroller action games, our concept could clarify the relationship between the stage contents, interface effects, and players skills and disabilities.},

abstract = {The standard assumption of identically distributed training and test data is violated when the test data are generated in response to the presence of a predictive model. This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam filtering. Here, email service providers employ spam filters, and spam senders engineer campaign templates to achieve a high rate of successful deliveries despite the filters. We model the interaction between the learner and the data generator as a static game in which the cost functions of the learner and the data generator are not necessarily antagonistic. We identify conditions under which this prediction game has a unique Nash equilibrium and derive algorithms that find the equilibrial prediction model. We derive two instances, the Nash logistic regression and the Nash support vector machine, and empirically explore their properties in a case study on email spam filtering.},

abstract = {Traditional software engineering dictates the use of modular and structured programming and top-down stepwise refinement techniques that reduce the amount of variability arising in the development process by establishing standard procedures to be followed while writing software. This focusing leads to reduced variability in the resulting products, due to the use of standardized constructs. Genetic programming (GP) performs heuristic search in the space of programs. Programs produced through the GP paradigm emerge as the result of simulated evolution and are built through a bottom-up process, incrementally augmenting their functionality until a satisfactory level of performance is reached. Can we automatically extract knowledge from the GP programming process that can be useful to focus the search and reduce product variability, thus leading to a more effective use of the available resources? An answer to this question is investigated with the aid of cultural algorithms. A new system, cultural algorithms with genetic programming (CAGP), is presented. The system has two levels. The first is the pool of genetic programs (population level), and the second is a knowledge repository (belief set) that is built during the GP run and is used to guide the search process. The microevolution within the population brings about potentially meaningful characteristics of the programs for the achievement of the given task, such as properties exhibited by the best performers in the population. CAGP extracts these features and represents them as the set of the current beliefs. Beliefs correspond to constraints that all the genetic operators and programs must follow. Interaction between the two levels occurs in one direction through the extraction process and, in the other, through the modulation of an individual's program parameters according to which, and how many, of the constraints it follows. CAGP is applied to solve an instance of the symbolic regression problem, in which a function of one variable needs to be discovered. The results of the experiments show an overall improvement on the average performance of CAGP over GP alone and a significant reduction of the complexity of the produced solution. Moreover, the execution time required by CAGP is comparable with the time required by GP alone.},
