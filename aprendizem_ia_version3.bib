abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of different musical styles on learning in virtual-immersive environments. As shown in other studies, music and musical training has positive effects on spatial-temporal reasoning (e.g., maths, chess). Music is also used in therapies to reduce stress or to aid children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In our study we want to use the findings from former investigations and combine these to create a holistic, immersive learning experience. The idea involves creating a 3d model of the Macquarie University icon (the Macquarie Lighthouse in Sydney) and use this model to develop a course about the history of the lighthouse. The users can explore the virtual environment in the style of a 3d adventure game and they will learn about the history of the lighthouse and colonial Sydney by interacting with virtual avatars. Within this framework we want to investigate the effect of Classical music, Rock/Pop music, Didgeridoo music, RAP music and compare these with nature sounds, white noise and silent conditions. We want to find out which musical style is most beneficial for learning and motivation in virtual-immersive environments. Our hypothesis is that instrumental music with a rate of 50 - 70 beats per minute (BPM) will be most beneficial for learning. This hypothesis is supported by other studies but has not been tested in virtual and immersive environments.},

abstract = {A particular challenge of the game design process is when the designer is requested to orchestrate dissimilar elements of games such as visuals, audio, narrative and rules to achieve a specific play experience. Within the domain of adversarial first person shooter games, for instance, a designer must be able to comprehend the differences between the weapons available in the game, and appropriately craft a game level to take advantage of strengths and weaknesses of those weapons. As an initial study towards computationally orchestrating dissimilar content generators in games, this paper presents a computational model which can classify a matchup of a team-based shooter game as balanced or as favoring one or the other team. The computational model uses convolutional neural networks to learn how game balance is affected by the level, represented as an image, and each team's weapon parameters. The model was trained on a corpus of over 50,000 simulated games with artificial agents on a diverse set of levels created by 39 different generators. The results show that the fusion of levels, when processed by a convolutional neural network, and weapon parameters yields an accuracy far above the baseline but also improves accuracy compared to artificial neural networks or models which use partial information, such as only the weapon or only the level as input.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence for the creation of game agents is fundamental to digital game development, enabling the design of new styles of games offering novel play experiences. Machine learning has long been used in the creation of digital games, most often for the purpose of creating game agent controllers that are trained off-line and do not learn during play. Little attention has been given to the possibility of game designs or mechanics that use machine learning to allow the player to train game agents on-line. This document outlines the design and implementation of Oui, Chef!!, a supervised learning game in which the player trains neural networks to map recipes to the ingredients necessary to make dishes in a restaurant. The game demonstrates that training game agents in a supervised manner provides a fun and engaging player experience wherein the effects of training are easily recognizable, and sometimes delightfully surprising.},
