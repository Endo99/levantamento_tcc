abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of different musical styles on learning in virtual-immersive environments. As shown in other studies, music and musical training has positive effects on spatial-temporal reasoning (e.g., maths, chess). Music is also used in therapies to reduce stress or to aid children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In our study we want to use the findings from former investigations and combine these to create a holistic, immersive learning experience. The idea involves creating a 3d model of the Macquarie University icon (the Macquarie Lighthouse in Sydney) and use this model to develop a course about the history of the lighthouse. The users can explore the virtual environment in the style of a 3d adventure game and they will learn about the history of the lighthouse and colonial Sydney by interacting with virtual avatars. Within this framework we want to investigate the effect of Classical music, Rock/Pop music, Didgeridoo music, RAP music and compare these with nature sounds, white noise and silent conditions. We want to find out which musical style is most beneficial for learning and motivation in virtual-immersive environments. Our hypothesis is that instrumental music with a rate of 50 - 70 beats per minute (BPM) will be most beneficial for learning. This hypothesis is supported by other studies but has not been tested in virtual and immersive environments.},

abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG)-based game design aims to reach a new way of playing games by focusing gameplay around algorithmic game content generation. However, positioning interaction with PCG systems and generated content to the center of player experience poses design challenges for both game design and AI design. In order to create the wanted affordances, rich contextual information is required to make informed decisions on the generated content. While previous research has presented excellent developments on PCG’s possibilities, further considering context and affordances in the early stages of prototyping may aid designers reach these possibilities in a more consistent manner. This study is set to discuss how context, affordances and the game’s overall design can be considered during the prototyping process of PCG-based games. Misaligned game context and affordances can result in deeply rooted design issues that may later manifest as subpar gameplay experiences and increased development effort. These emergent issues are examined through a post-mortem case study to produce an extended PCG-based design process, featuring actionable steps, that takes context, affordances, and the game’s overall design into account through meaningful play.},

abstract = {Games for learning cannot take the same design approach as games when targeting audiences. While players of entertainment games have the luxury of choosing games that suit them, students using digital games for learning typically have a single game for them to learn from, regardless of whether or not it fits their playing style or learning needs. We contend that this problem can be addressed by creating games that identify the kind of player-learner using the game and adapts itself to best fit that individual. These adaptive games can specialize themselves according to a student's learning needs, gameplay preferences, and learning style. We present a prototype mini-game, called S.C.R.U.B., which employs this method for teaching microbiology concepts.},

abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can be used to design game-based learning systems because it has the excellent ability of concept representation and reasoning. However, it can not (1) get new knowledge from existing data and (2) correct false transcendental knowledge by itself, which mars the game-based learning ability. This paper utilizes Hebbian learning rule to solve the first problem and uses unbalance degree to solve the second problem. As a result, the improved FCM has the ability of self-learning from both existing data and priori knowledge, and is more suitable for a game-based learning system. Based on the improved FCM, a novel game-based learning model is proposed, including a teacher submodel, a learner submodel and a set of learning mechanisms. The teacher submodel has the standard answers which can be deduced from the improved FCM. The learner submodel is bulit and adjusted according to the teacher's FCM, which reflects the learner's learning process. The learning mechanisms compute the difference between the outputs of the teacher submodel and the learner submodel, and control the whole game learning process according to the difference. Based on the proposed model, an automobile driving learning system is developed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our model validity in terms of controlling the learning process and the guiding learners learning.},

abstract = {The conventional way of teaching IT is increasingly not attractive to students of today. For example, covering the various topics in Computer Science is not exactly exciting when students are taught the theory and then asked to practice by coming up with solutions to "made-up" problems. These solutions then get discarded when they move on to a new topic. A computer game can involve most and possibly all topics in Computer Science. When working on computer games, instead of discarding solutions that students worked on earlier, students learn to incorporate solutions to previous problems into newer solutions. The final product is a lot more sophisticated and students can actually feel proud of what they have achieved. They can also have enjoyed themselves along the way. They would have learnt that topics they have studied had a purpose. This is useful, as quite often, students cannot figure out why they need to study a particular topic, especially if they are finding it hard. In this paper, we suggest that game construction can be an effective learning tool.},

abstract = {A particular challenge of the game design process is when the designer is requested to orchestrate dissimilar elements of games such as visuals, audio, narrative and rules to achieve a specific play experience. Within the domain of adversarial first person shooter games, for instance, a designer must be able to comprehend the differences between the weapons available in the game, and appropriately craft a game level to take advantage of strengths and weaknesses of those weapons. As an initial study towards computationally orchestrating dissimilar content generators in games, this paper presents a computational model which can classify a matchup of a team-based shooter game as balanced or as favoring one or the other team. The computational model uses convolutional neural networks to learn how game balance is affected by the level, represented as an image, and each team's weapon parameters. The model was trained on a corpus of over 50,000 simulated games with artificial agents on a diverse set of levels created by 39 different generators. The results show that the fusion of levels, when processed by a convolutional neural network, and weapon parameters yields an accuracy far above the baseline but also improves accuracy compared to artificial neural networks or models which use partial information, such as only the weapon or only the level as input.},

With the enhancement of information technology, Web-based learning has been promoted as an alternative teaching and learning methodology. Digital games, an interactive piece of technology within the multimedia learning environment, could foster the learning process effectively and interestingly especially among young learners. Researchers and game designers have noted this promising technology and proposed some frameworks and models to foster multimedia learning environment.

Machine learning has long been used in the creation of digital games, most often for the purpose of creating game agent controllers that are trained off-line and do not learn during play. Little attention has been given to the possibility of game designs or mechanics that use machine learning to allow the player to train game agents on-line. This document outlines the design and implementation of Oui, Chef!!, a supervised learning game in which the player trains neural networks to map recipes to the ingredients necessary to make dishes in a restaurant. The game demonstrates that training game agents in a supervised manner provides a fun and engaging player experience wherein the effects of training are easily recognizable, and sometimes delightfully surprising.},

abstract = {A long-standing goal in artificial intelligence and robotics is synthesising agents that can effectively learn and adapt throughout their lifetime. One open-ended approach to behaviour learning in autonomous robots is online evolution, which is part of the evolutionary robotics field of research. In online evolution approaches, an evolutionary algorithm is executed on the robots during task execution, which enables continuous optimisation and adaptation of behaviour. Despite the potential for automatic behaviour learning, online evolution has not been widely adopted because it often requires several hours or days to synthesise solutions to a given task. In this respect, research in the field has failed to develop a prevalent algorithm able to effectively synthesise solutions to a large number of different tasks in a timely manner. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we argue for more general mechanisms that can combine the benefits of different algorithms to increase the performance of online evolution of robot controllers. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of a novel approach called online hyper-evolution (OHE). Robots executing OHE use the different sources of feedback information traditionally associated with controller evaluation to find effective evolutionary algorithms during task execution. First, we study two approaches: OHE-fitness, which uses the fitness score of controllers as the criterion to select promising algorithms over time, and OHE-diversity, which relies on the behavioural diversity of controllers for algorithm selection. We then propose a novel class of techniques called OHE-hybrid, which combine diversity and fitness to search for suitable algorithms. In addition to their effectiveness at selecting suitable algorithms, the different OHE approaches are evaluated for their ability to construct algorithms by controlling which algorithmic components should be employed for controller generation (e.g., mutation, crossover, among others), an unprecedented approach in evolutionary robotics. Results show that OHE (i) facilitates the evolution of controllers with high performance, (ii) can increase effectiveness at different stages of evolution by combining the benefits of multiple algorithms over time, and (iii) can be effectively applied to construct new algorithms during task execution. Overall, our study shows that OHE is a powerful new paradigm that allows robots to improve their learning process as they operate in the task environment.},

abstract = {Although many computer games have become diversified in recent years, much effort and ingenuity are needed to produce games that persons with visual impairments can enjoy. However, game developers face difficulties in adjusting the parameters of these games, including difficulty and interface features, because the control skills and disability conditions of gamers vary. Thus, it is essential to establish a scheme to evaluate game interfaces and stages with individuals trials with a short time. In this study, our purpose is to propose and establish the concept of GAME (Game As a Measurement Environment) that can evaluate game interfaces and stages. This concept aims to divide a game stage into substages and then randomly allocate them to the stage. Then, the generated stage records the play logs and play conditions and then analyzes them logs based on test theories, including classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Based on the analysis of the gathered play logs of side-scroller action games, our concept could clarify the relationship between the stage contents, interface effects, and players skills and disabilities.},
